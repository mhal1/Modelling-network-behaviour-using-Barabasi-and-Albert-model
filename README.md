# Modelling-network-behaviour-using-Barabasi-and-Albert-model

Theoretical derivations for the degree distribution were compared to numerical simulation data. Preferential attachment, random attachment and an attachment which allows self-loops and a mixed preferential and random attachment schemes were implemented in Python 3.6.4.

# Network model
